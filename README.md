# Precision Alignment Tool
Originally written by Wenli, previously maintained by TweaK.

Adapted calculations from client-sided to server-sided by Summer

I (giinuu) will be looking to maintain this project more regularly going forwards.

I've forked off the most recent version that is available on github that was forked from the original.
